                            He recognizes the benefit of meeting with you weekly and it is reflected in his current
                            grade and last yearâ€™s AP exam results.
                            Iâ€™m very pleased that Owen can suggest areas of weakness or confusion just prior to your

                        <p class="testimonial-text">I have worked with Subeka for three years in AP Physics 1, 2, and C,
                            and during that time Iâ€™ve seen my own growth as a physicist. When I first started working
                            with her, I attended the sessions mainly to do well in school and on the AP test because
                            physics was a hard subject for me. But over the three years, while physics is still
                            challenging, I started showing up because I genuinely became interested in the content and
                            knew I had the tools to solve difficult problems. This shift in perspective is thanks to
                            Subekaâ€™s unique teaching style, which is super organized and focused on application. At
                            school, Iâ€™d learn a concept but wouldnâ€™t really be taught how to use it. In Subekaâ€™s
                            sessions, you get to watch her work through problems and then practice solving them
                            yourself.

                        <p class="testimonial-text">My Advice for New Students: Subeka is an amazing teacher, but how
                            much you get out of her sessions really depends on how much you're willing to put in. So my
                            most important piece of advice is to follow her plan: do the homework, take the practice
                            seriously, and ask questions. She creates a space where it's okay to be confused and learn
                            at your own pace, which is rare and reallyÂ valuable.</p>

                            Iâ€™m very pleased that Owen can suggest areas of weakness or confusion just prior to your

                        <p class="testimonial-text">I have worked with Subeka for three years in AP Physics 1, 2, and C,
                            and during that time Iâ€™ve seen my own growth as a physicist. When I first started working
                            with her, I attended the sessions mainly to do well in school and on the AP test because
                            physics was a hard subject for me. But over the three years, while physics is still
                            challenging, I started showing up because I genuinely became interested in the content and
                            knew I had the tools to solve difficult problems. This shift in perspective is thanks to
                            Subekaâ€™s unique teaching style, which is super organized and focused on application. At
                            school, Iâ€™d learn a concept but wouldnâ€™t really be taught how to use it. In Subekaâ€™s
                            sessions, you get to watch her work through problems and then practice solving them
                            yourself.

                        <p class="testimonial-text">My Advice for New Students: Subeka is an amazing teacher, but how
                            much you get out of her sessions really depends on how much you're willing to put in. So my
                            most important piece of advice is to follow her plan: do the homework, take the practice
                            seriously, and ask questions. She creates a space where it's okay to be confused and learn
                            at your own pace, which is rare and reallyÂ valuable.</p>
