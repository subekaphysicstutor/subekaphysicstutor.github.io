                    My name is Subeka Chhabra, and I am thrilled to be a part of your academic journey.
                    Teaching Physics is not just my profession; it is my true passion. With over nineteen years of dedicated experience in the field, I possess a wealth of knowledge that allows me to provide exceptional academic expertise to my students.
                    </br></br>
                    My teaching journey has encompassed tutoring both small and large groups, providing private individual tutoring, and teaching in both traditional classroom and home settings.
                    This breadth of experience has enriched my understanding of various learning styles and enables me to tailor my approach to meet the unique needs of each student.
