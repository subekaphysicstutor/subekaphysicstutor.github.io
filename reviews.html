                    Subeka, your tutoring has immensely helped my son develop in-depth understanding and great passion for Physics. He has been consistently performing well in the school tests and projects, thanks to your help with the topics in advance.
                    I am glad that I was able to find the right tutor for my son, helping him excel in one of the toughest subjects in High School.

                    Your tutoring sessions have helped keep AP Physics 2 stress free! As a parent, I really appreciate the extra support to classroom learning and the small group format is perfect since it keeps the sessions going at a good pace,
                     students are accountable for their participation and effort, and they benefit from personalized attention as well.
                     I also greatly appreciate that the sessions are reasonably priced.

                    I’m am so thankful that Owen enjoys the tutoring time you provide. He appreciates your teaching style and personality. 
                    He recognizes the benefit of meeting with you weekly and it is reflected in his current grade and last year’s AP exam results.
                    I’m very pleased that Owen can suggest areas of weakness or confusion just prior to your session and those things are always addressed. This helps him have confidence in the following school day and exams.

                    Thank you so much for being my physics tutor this year. I checked my college board today morning in shock and saw that I had received a 5 on the exam!
                    This score definitely wouldn't have been possible without your help every week, and I appreciate your hard work so much!
