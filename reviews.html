                    Subeka, your tutoring has immensely helped my son develop in-depth understanding and great passion for Physics. He has been consistently performing well in the school tests and projects, thanks to your help with the topics in advance.
                    I am glad that I was able to find the right tutor for my son, helping him excel in one of the toughest subjects in High School.

                    Your tutoring sessions have helped keep AP Physics 2 stress free! As a parent, I really appreciate the extra support to classroom learning and the small group format is perfect since it keeps the sessions going at a good pace,
                     students are accountable for their participation and effort, and they benefit from personalized attention as well.
                     I also greatly appreciate that the sessions are reasonably priced.
